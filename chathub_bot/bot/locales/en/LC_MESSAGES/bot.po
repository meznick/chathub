"*Event Rules*\n"
"Speed dating is an event where participants engage in brief, timed "
"conversations with different people to assess mutual interest for further"
" interaction\\. To ensure that the experience is productive and "
"enjoyable, please keep in mind:\n"
"\\- Do not be late for the start of the event\\.\n"
"\\- Each pair converses for 5 minutes, with a 1-minute break between "
"rounds\\.\n"
"\\- During the break, you can jot down your impressions or simply "
"relax\\.\n"
"\\- The number of rounds depends on the number of participants\\.\n"
"\\- Participants are matched using a smart algorithm that will improve "
"over time to find the best matches\\.\n"
"\\- After the final round, you will have the opportunity to select those "
"you liked, and if the choice is mutual, you can exchange contact "
"information\\.\n"
"Thank you, and enjoy the event\\!"
