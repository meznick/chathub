"*Event Rules* 🎉\n"
"In short: Be polite, dress appropriately, maintain eye contact with your "
"conversation partner, and enjoy yourself! 🌟\n"
"\n"
"1️⃣ *Your Comfort is Key*\n"
"Feel like chatting in cozy pajamas? Or a Star Wars stormtrooper costume? "
"Go for it! Just make sure you're dressed—otherwise, we may need to limit "
"your participation. For quality assurance, all calls are securely "
"recorded and remain confidential.\n"
"\n"
"2️⃣ *Keep It Fun and Light*\n"
"Share a funny story, pick a quirky virtual background, or start a "
"conversation on an unusual topic! 🚀 However, personal boundaries must be "
"respected, and negativity toward others will lead to removal from the "
"event.\n"
"\n"
"3️⃣ *Genuine Connection Matters*\n"
"Laughter and eye contact set us apart from anonymous dating chats. For "
"this reason, communication is non-anonymous—your face must be clearly "
"visible on camera. 🎥\n"
"\n"
"4️⃣ *Your Comfort Comes First*\n"
"If you feel uncomfortable during a date, you can always end it early. 💔 "
"But please use this option considerately—our service values kind and "
"respectful communication.\n"
"\n"
"XOXO ❤️"
